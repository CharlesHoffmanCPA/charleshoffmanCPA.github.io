# Examples

Provides sets of example XBRL taxonomies, XBRL linkbases, XBRL formulas, and XBRL instances.  All examples have been validated using numerous XBRL processors.  The examples are small and are a great way to learn details about how XBRL works, how to represent specific information using XBRL, etc.

It is recommended that you start with the "hello-world" examples.  From there, work with the "concept-arrangement-patterns", the "member-arrangment-patterns", and the "business-use-cases".  The other examples build on those first basic examples.
