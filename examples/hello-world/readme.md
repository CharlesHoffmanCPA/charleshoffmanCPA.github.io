# Hello World!

This is a very basic example of XBRL.

STEP 1 includes only an XBRL instance and and XBRL taxonomy schema.  You can automatically generate both using an Excel application which is provided.

STEP 2 introduces other XBRL linkbases.

If you want to get started with the XBRL technical syntax, I would highly recommend Chapter 4 of XBRL for Dummies which provides a primer for the XBRL technical syntax. [XBRL for Dummies](http://xbrl.squarespace.com/xbrl-for-dummies/)
