# Comprehensive Example

[Link to Raw XBRL](https://charleshoffmanCPA.github.io/examples/comprehensive-example/xasb/company-instance.xml)

The comprehensive example takes all the individual business use cases and combines them into one XBRL instance creating an integrated unit which tests the inter-relations between the individual report fragments of the report to make sure everything fits toghether appropriately.

Neither the US GAAP nor IFRS XBRL taxonomies were used.  Rather, a taxonomy was created to avoid being constrained by the US GAAP or IFRS taxonomies.  Note that the modularity of this XBRL taxonomy is not appropriate.  This modularity was used simply because it was the easiest way to create this taxonomy with the software that was used.

Extensive us of XBRL Formula was made therefore this provides some very good examples.
