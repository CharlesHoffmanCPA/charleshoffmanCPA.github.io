[Conceptual Model of a Digital Financial Report](http://xbrlsite.azurewebsites.net/2017/IntelligentDigitalFinancialReporting/Part02_Chapter05.1_IntroductionToTheConceptualModelOfDigitalFinancialReport.pdf)

* A **fact** defines a single, observable, reportable piece of information contained within a financial report, or fact value, contextualized for unambiguous interpretation or analysis by one or more distinguishing characteristics.  Facts can be numbers, text, or prose.
* A financial **report** provides facts.
* Facts can be organized into report fragments or sets.
* A set or a report fragment represents a **block** (used as a matter of convenience).
* A **disclosure** is represented using one or many blocks.
* One fact is distinguished from another fact using **aspects**.  (Another term for aspect is characteristic.)
* Disclosures can be organized into **topics**.
* A fact can be **PART-OF** (WHOLE-PART) another fact.
* A fact can be a **TYPE-OF** (IS-A) some other fact.
* A fact can be **computationally related** (roll up, roll forward, adjustment, variance, etc.) to another fact.
* A fact can be **PART OF** (an intersection between) two or more report fragments.
* A **fact table** is a set of facts which go together for some specific reason which can be described. (A fact table correlates with a report fragment).
* **Grain** is the level of depth of information or granularity.
